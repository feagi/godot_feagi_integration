# FEAGI Godot Integrator

This Godot plugin allows for easily adding FEAGI integration with your Godot game!

This repo includes a demo of this plugin in use using the 'Dodge the Creeps' demo as well, to see how it can be used.

To configure your connection to FEAGI, go to the Project tab -> Tools -> Open FEAGI Configurator. Here you can setup connection settings, and define virtual devices
